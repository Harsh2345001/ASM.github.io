## STRESS COMPONENTS ON AN ARBITRARY PLANE
It was stated that a knowledge of stress components acting on three
mutually perpendicular planes passing through a point will enable one to determine the stress components acting on any plane passing through that point. Let
the three mutually perpendicular planes be the x, y and z planes and let the
arbitrary plane be identified by its outward drawn normal **n**.

whose direction cosines are nx, ny and nz. Consider a small tetrahedron at P with three of its faces normal to the coordinate axes, and the inclined face having its normal parallel to **n**. Let h be the perpendicular distance from P to the inclined face. If the tetrahedron is isolated from the body and a free-body diagram is drawn, then it will be in equilibrium under the action of the surface forces and the body forces. The free-body diagram is shown in Fig.

Since the size of the tetrahedron considered is very small and in the limit as we are going to make h tend to zero, we shall speak in terms of the average stresses
over the faces. Let **Tn** be the resultant stress vector on face ABC. This can be resolved into components *Tnx*, *Tny*, *Tnz* parallel to the three axes x, y and z. On the three faces, the rectangular stress components are &sigma;x, &tau;xy, &tau;xz,  &sigma;y, &tau;yz, &tau;yx,  &sigma;z, &tau;zx, &tau;zy
